\section{Motivating Example}
\label{sec:problem}

In order to customize specific products, by selecting a valid feature
configuration, variation points must be represented in the product line
artifacts. Several notations for representing variation points in use case
scenarios have been proposed, such as Product Line Use Cases
(PLUC)~\cite{Bertolino:2003aa} and Product Line Use Case Modeling for Systems
and Software Engineering (PLUSS)~\cite{eriksson-splc-2005}. However, in spite of
the benefits for variability representation, existing works do not present a
clear separation between variability management and scenario specifications. In this
section we illustrate the resulting problems using the \emph{eShop Product
Line}~\cite{eshop-url} as a motivating example.

The primary use cases of \emph{eShop Product Line} (EPL) allow the user to
\emph{Register as a Customer}, \emph{Search for Products}, and \emph{Buy
Products}.  Five variant features are described in the original specification,
corresponding to a family composed by 72 valid configurations~\cite{eshop-url}.
In this paper we consider additional features, such as \emph{Update User
Preferences}, which updates the user's preferences based on her
historical data of searches and purchases. Figure~\ref{fig:eshop-fm} presents part of the
EPL feature model~\cite{gheyi-alloy-06,Czarnecki:2000aa}.

A feature model is used for representing the common and variable features of a
SPL and the dependencies between them. A feature model might be represented as a tree
like notation whose relationships between a parent feature and its children are
categorized as: \emph{Optional} (features that might not be selected in a
specific product), \emph{Mandatory} (feature that must be selected, if the parent
is also selected), \emph{Or} (one or more subfeatures might be selected), and
\emph{Alternative} (exactly one subfeature must be selected for each product).
Besides these relationships, feature models allow the specification of
constraints among features. For instance, the constraint ($shoppingCart
\Leftrightarrow bonus$) states that the feature Shopping Cart is selected iff
the feature Bonus is also selected.

  \end{center}
\end{figure}


%Other approaches are based on use case extensions~\cite{jacobson-reuse-book}, not explored here since they
%require that one use case extension must be defined for each variant. This can result in a huge
%number of use cases that is not suitable for managing activities.


Figure~\ref{fig:pluss-01} depicts the \emph{Buy Product} scenario written in the
PLUSS notation. Notice that a single artifact is used to represent all valid
configurations related to this behavior. For example, steps 1(a) and 1(b) are
never performed together. They are alternative steps: Step 1(a) will be present only if
the \emph{Shopping Cart} feature is selected (otherwise Step 1(b) will be
present). In a similar way, we have to choose between options (a) and (b) for
Step 2 (depending on the \emph{Bonus} feature has been selected or not). Finally,
Step 6 is optional and would be present only if the feature \emph{Update User
Preference} was selected.

As a consequence, PLUSS approach presents difficulties for understanding the
behavior of specific products, because all possible variants are described in the
same artifact. Moreover, such a tangling between \emph{common} and
\emph{variant} behavior results in maintainability issues: introducing a new product variant
requires changes in several points of existing artifacts. To sum  up, the effort
needed to understand and evolve a product line increases, since the behavior of
certain features are spread among several scenarios and each specification
describes several configurations.

% In the PLUSS notation, this kind of relationship between
% features and scenarios is scattered throughout different scenarios.

% Section~\ref{sec:evaluation} presents a quantitative study regarded to the PLUSS'
% maintanability issues.

% For example, including a \emph{B2B Integration}
% feature, which allows the integration between partners in order to share their warehouses, might change the specification of the \emph{Buy
% Product} scenario, enabling the search for product availability in remote
% warehouses (a new variant for Step 1) and updating a remote warehouse when the
% user confirms the purchase (a new variant for Step 5). Moreover, the inclusion of
% this new optional feature also changes the specification of the \emph{Search for
% Products} scenario (the search might also be remote). In summary, since the
% behavior of certain features may be spread among several specifications and each
% specification might describe several variants, the effort needed to understand
% and evolve the product line might increase.


Differently, PLUC introduces special tags for representing variation points in
use case scenarios. For example, the VP1 tag in Figure~\ref{fig:pluc-01}, which also
describes the \emph{Buy Products} scenario, denotes a variation point that might
assume the values ``\emph{checkout}'' or ``\emph{buy product}'', depending on
which product is being configured. For each \emph{alternative} or
\emph{optional} step, one tag must be defined. The actual value of each tag is specified in the
\emph{Variation Points} section of a scenario specification.

Another kind of tangling occurs in this case, since segments of the
specification are tangled with the variation points. Additionally, SPL members
are also described using the same tag notation (see the \emph{Product Definition}
section in Figure~\ref{fig:pluc-01}). There is no explicit relationship between
product configurations and feature models. In the example, two products (P1 and
P2) are defined. The first product is configured by an implicit selection of
the \emph{Shopping Cart}, \emph{Bonus}, and \emph{Update User Preferences}
features; in contrast to the second model that is not configured with these
features.

Once the values of alternative and optional variation points are computed based
on the defined products, instead of specific features, the inclusion of a new
member in the product line might require a deep review of variation points.
Moreover, since the variation points and the product definitions are spread among
several scenario specifications, it is hard and time consuming to keep the SPL
consistent. Finally, the same definitions (product configuration and variation
points) often are useful to manage variabilities in other artifacts, such as
design and source code. As a consequence, this approach requires the replication
of such definitions in different SPL views --- when the SPL evolves, changes are
propagated throughout many artifacts.

In conclusion, both PlUSS and PLUC approaches rely on simple composition
techniques: filtering optional steps in scenarios or syntactic changes of tag
values based on product definition. In this sense, according to the terminology
presented in~\cite{}, they can be classified as \emph{annotated techniques},
which are not suitable for modularizing the crosscutting nature of certain
features, have poor legibility, and lead to lower
maintainability~\cite{Alves:2006aa}. For this reason, Pohl et al.
argued that the variability management concern should be separated from the other
SPL assets~\cite{Pohl:2005aa}. However, besides the use of independent models
for representing the variability concern, it is also necessary concrete
descriptions of the composition processes used to generate specific products.

% this case, in order to support the automatic derivation of product specific
% artifacts, it is necessary not only to have a more precise definition of each
% language used to describe product line artifacts and the variability management
% concern, but also to formalize the weaving processes used to combine them.
%
% The
% PLUSS and PLUC approaches fail in this direction, since Eriksson et al. defines
% the metamodel of PLUSS notation~\cite{eriksson-splc-2005}, but do not describe
% which languages and processes are used for relating use case scenarios to feature
% models. Likewise, although Fantechi et al. describe the formal semantics of
% PLUC~\cite{fantechi-splc-2004}, this approach does not separate variability
% management from use case scenarios.

Next section describes our approach that considers scenario variability as a
composition of different artifacts. Although in this paper we are focus on use
case scenarios, the idea of separating product line artifacts from variability
management (using feature models, product configurations, and configuration
knowledge) is also applied to other SPL views.
