\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:conclusions}

In this paper we formally described variability management as crosscutting
mechanisms, considering the contribution of different input languages that
crosscut each other for deriving specific members of a product line. We applied
this notion of variability management in the context of use case scenarios,
achieving a clear separation of
concerns between variability and scenario specifications and allowing both
representations to evolve independently. Moreover, for different case studies our approach improved both feature modularity and scenario cohesion. 

%Finally, we achieved a
%reduction in the size of specifications by composing scenarios in a quantified
%way. 

% Besides that, investigating the effort for specifying a SPL in existing
% approaches is an issue for future research.

% Although our modeling framework was instantiated for representing
% scenario variabilities, we believe that it could assist the modular design of variability mechanisms to other kinds of artifacts. Particularly, optional and parameterized artifacts
% are also relevant for non-functional requirements and test cases.

% Moreover, our notion of crosscutting was based on a work target at source code definitions of crosscutting. Therefore,
% we argue that representing variabilities in source code, using our modeling framework,
% is straightforward.

%As future work, we would like to apply our notion of variability management in order
%to identify relationships between
%variabilities at different SPL artifacts (in a first moment, relationships between
%requirements and test artifacts). Such kind of relationships can help in the product
%generation and traceability activities of a SPL.
%The modeling
%framework proposed in this work takes a step in this direction, since the
%composition process used to derive product specific scenarios have been formally represented.
