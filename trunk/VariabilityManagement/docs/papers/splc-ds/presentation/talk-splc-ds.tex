\section{Introduction}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Software Product Line (SPL)}

\begin{block}{Definition}
\begin{itemize}
  \item The SPL approach is a well known technique for implementing systematic
  reuse in software engineering.
  \item Based on this approach, products are customized (or generated) from a
  set of reusable assets.
\end{itemize}
\end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Software Product Line (SPL)}

\begin{block}{Technical point: variability management}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Reusable assets are extensible by means of variation points.
  \item Different techniques might be used to solve these VPs.
  \item Product decisions (capabilities) drive the generation process.
\end{itemize}
\end{block}

\frametitle{Thesis context}

\begin{block}{Variability Management Problem}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Variable features often require variation points to be scattered trough
	different places in requirements, design, code, and test artifacts.
	\item As a consequence, it is painful to evolve a product line if it does not 
	exist a clear separation between variability concern and domain concerns.
\end{itemize}
\end{block}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Thesis context}

\begin{block}{Hypothesis}
A better separation between VM and software engineering
artifacts improve:

\begin{itemize}
  \item SPL Evolvability
  \item SPL Traceability
  \item SPL Configurability
\end{itemize}
\end{block}

\begin{block}{Proposed approach:}
Improve this SoC by means of representing Variability Management as
crosscutting mechanisms.
\end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Thesis context}

\begin{block}{VM as crosscutting mechanisms}
Different input models crosscut each other with respect to a SPL member
(adapted from Masuhara and Kiczales - ECOOP 2003).

\begin{block}{Weaving Process}
\begin{itemize}
  \hilite<1> \item sequence of weavers, guided by the
  configuration knowledge, that should be applied in order to generate specific instances.
  \hilite<2> \item Each weaver is represented as a tuple, which highlights the
  contribution of the corresponding input languages.
  \hilite<3> \item by relating the tuple elements to a reference
  implementation of the weaver.
\end{itemize}
