\chapter{Smart Home Case Study}

This study aimed at comparing feature modularity of PLUSS and MSVCM
specifications. Initially, three different products of the security module of a
Smart Home family~\cite{Pohl:2005aa} were specified. Almost six use cases and
fifteen scenarios are present in each product, with a significant number of
duplicated steps among them. These specifications, available on-line, were used
as input data. Then, six students, organized in groups, were assigned to identify
the commonalities and variabilities among the products, and to restructure the
input specifications. Two SPL specifications were produced, one using the PLUSS
notation and the other one using the MSVCM approach

\section{PLUSS specifications}
In  this Section we present the PLUSS specifications of the Smart Home case
study.
