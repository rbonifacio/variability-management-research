                software project that can affect multiple dispersed
                implementation entities (functions, classes, etc.). In
                this paper, we examine large-scale refinements in terms
                of a fundamental object-oriented technique called
                collaboration-based design. We explain how
                collaborations can be expressed in existing programming
                languages or can be supported with new language
                constructs (which we have implemented as extensions to
                the Java language). We present a specific expression of
                large-scale refinements called mixin layers, and
                demonstrate how it overcomes the scalability
                difficulties that plagued prior work. We also show how
                we used mixin layers as the primary implementation
                technique for building an extensible Java compiler,
                JTS.",

 abstract =    "This paper reports our experience using AspectJ, a
                general-purpose aspect-oriented extension to Java, to
                implement distribution and persistence aspects in a
                web-based information system. This system was
                originally implemented in Java and restructured with
                AspectJ. Our main contribution is to show that AspectJ
                is useful for implementing several persistence and
                distribution concerns in the application considered,
                and other similar applications. We have also identified
                a few drawbacks in the language and suggest some minor
                modifications that could significantly improve similar
                implementations. Despite the drawbacks, we argue that
                the AspectJ implementation is superior to the pure Java
                implementation. Some of the aspects implemented in our
                experiment are abstract and constitute a simple aspect
                framework. The other aspects are application specific
                but we suggest that different implementations might
                follow the same aspect pattern. The framework and the
                pattern allow us to propose architecture-specific
                guidelines that provide practical advice for both
                restructuring and implementing certain kinds of
                persistent and distributed applications with AspectJ.",
