This paper presents a variability management framework for Software Product<br>Lines. In particular, use case scenario variability management is advocated -<br>from a use case model, feature model, product configuration, and configuration<br>knowledge the product specific use case model is obtained. The main<br>contribution of this paper is to show that there is a clear separation between<br>variability management and scenario specification (although this contribution<br>was already presented in authors' workshop paper at AOSD'08) and a description<br>of the framework for modeling the composition process of scenario variability<br>mechanisms (particularly, how selection of optional scenarios, scenario<br>composition, and scenario parameterization are performed in this framework). <br><br>After briefly introducing the problem statement, the motivating example (eShop<br>Product Line) is given. In section 3, the core of the paper is discussed –<br>first, variability as crosscutting is briefly introduced, and then explained on<br>a running example. The main part of this section is a description of the<br>modeling framework by explaining implementation of different weavers (product<br>derivation weaver, scenario composition weaver, bind parameters weaver). A<br>description of model verification is also given in this section. In section 4,<br>evaluation of the proposed approach is given by DSM (Design Structure Matrices)<br>analysis and quantitative analysis using different measure (e.g., feature<br>diffusion over use case, number of features pre use case). The paper ends with<br>a short description of related work and a conclusion. <br><br><br>
          &gt;&gt;&gt; Evaluation &lt;&lt;&lt;

The idea that is explored in this paper is quite novel an unique – the<br>consideration of variability management at the use case level may offer<br>benefits, especially with the separation of the variability from the scenario<br>specification. Although I liked the concepts explored in the paper, I still<br>have some concerns, as listed below.<br><br>I did not find the introduction as appealing as it could be. I think the<br>authors sort of sell their idea a little short by the manner in which the<br>introduction is written. The authors do not stress enough (in my opinion) the<br>importance of the problem they are dealing with. From the current description I<br>can see that the problem certainly exists and that some other researchers<br>proposed a solution, too. But, I can not see how crucial this problem is for<br>real software developers. How important is to solve this problem (I believe it<br>is very important, but the paper is not as strong in making the case as could<br>be)? <br><br>The authors have already shown that there is a clear separation between<br>variability management and scenario specification in their AOSD'08 workshop<br>paper (ref [7] I this paper). Despite that, it is clear that this paper is a<br>sufficient extension of the workshop paper. What is new in this paper appears<br>to be the description of the modeling framework (section 3.2) by showing<br>implementation of different weavers (product derivation weaver, scenario<br>composition weaver, bind parameters weaver). The rest of the paper is some<br>minor improvement over workshop paper.<br><br>A reader of this paper will notice that using the proposed approach assists<br>with the mean value of feature diffusion over use cases drop from 3.5 using the<br>PLUSS approach to 2 (on multimedia message product line) or from 1.3 to 1.2 (on<br>pedagogical product line). How significant are these results on these examples?<br>The benefits appear somewhat minor in these cases. Are there some other<br>difficulties using the proposed approach? Seems that this approach introduce<br>some hidden dependencies which might be difficult to follow.<br><br>Claiming that you are formally describing a modeling framework in section 3.2<br>may be a bit questionable. You just provide the implementation of weavers in<br>the functional language Haskell. Semantics of weavers is also not described<br>formally by functional code.<br><br>Running example 3.1 may not be that compelling. It can be shortened since<br>annotation [RegisterPreference] is included in Figure 7 and 8. Furthermore, the<br>description refers to some identifiers that are not explained. For example,<br>what does Step1M refer to in the statement "… and finishing at the Step 1M of<br>the Proceed to Purchase scenario …". The same is true for statement " …<br>ShipMethod is referenced in Step 4M of Figure 7". <br><br>Comparing "from step and to step" from Figure 7 and right complete graphs on<br>Figure 12 the reader can notice that "to step" is not "END" as specified in<br>Figure 7, but R1 which was weaved afterward. Short comment is in order to<br>explain this (or to improve my understanding if I am wrong here).<br><br>Section 3.2 seems to be out of the scope of the paper. It just shows that you<br>test and verify your implementation in Haskell. The discussion in this section<br>has very minor impact to the main contribution of the paper. It also feels like<br>you just wanted brownie points for mentioning Haskell in the paper.<br><br>The related work section is a bit weak. There is no deep related work<br>comparison. Claims such as "we believe that the textual language is the<br>preferred representation for scenario specification" could be omitted since<br>they are not supported by experiments. Perhaps explain your view of textual<br>languages would be insightful to readers.<br><br><br>Minor problems:<br><br>I did not really understand the connection between Figures 1 and 2. Some of the<br>names are not the same and I was expecting some linkage.<br><br>Figure 11 seems to come out of the blue. This is some sort of configuration<br>tree control that appears to be a part of some tool that has yet to be<br>described.<br><br>Many figures (e.g., 1, 4, 10, 15) are too small and hard to read. Please<br>expand.<br><br>The order of features in Figure 10 (Shopping Cart, Bonus) and Figure 11 (Bonus,<br>Shopping Cart) is not the same.<br><br>Missing information about how constraints are described in a feature model<br>(Section 3.1.2).<br><br>I could not see what are 7 parameters (for each weaver) in the statement "We<br>represent each weaver by filling in the seven parameters of our 6-tuple<br>representation, …".

The authors appear to be saying the following. A product-line<br>definition has several components, including a feature model,<br>use-cases, etc. The addition of features impacts the use-cases in a<br>cross-cutting way. Therefore, it would be nice to have a language for<br>writing these better in the way we've grown accustomed to with<br>aspects.<br><br><br><br>
          &gt;&gt;&gt; Evaluation &lt;&lt;&lt;

If my summary above is wrong, then I may have missed the point of this<br>paper. If it is right (or close enough to right), then I'm just not<br>convinced about the magnitude of the contribution here. The<br>specifications just aren't all that large; even your "industrial" spec<br>doesn't show a whole lot of size. Therefore, while this work would be<br>interesting at a much narrower conference, like SPLC or AOSD, but I<br>just don't see an OOPSLA paper's worth of contribution here.<br><br>Some small comments:<br><br>I don't see what's hard about the specification of the scenario<br>composer.<br><br>I would avoid calling the use of HUnit/QuickCheck "verification" --<br>surely you know better!<br><br>[9] is in ICFP, not ICSP. Citation [27] is completely scrambled. I<br>find it very strange that you list the publication venues by<br>abbreviation -- even for obscure ones -- but print the location, as if<br>one might fly to those cities to find the proceedings. If you want to<br>save space, please do so *usefully* (cut out the cities and give the<br>names of the conferences).<br><br>The English needs significant work.<br><br><br><br>
