Variability management allows product customization by specifying variation points and composition rules related to feature models and product configurations. This is an interesting kind of crosscutting concern, since a feature might require variation points to be spread into different artifacts of each Software Product Line model (requirements, design, source code, and tests). In order to modularize use case scenario variability management, we proposed a crosscutting approach that weaves scenarios, feature models, product configurations, and configuration knowledge. The result leads to independent specification of behavior and variability concerns. The weave process was modeled using a Haskell library. In the next steps of this research we will extend our models to represent variability management in design and test artifacts.
