This page briefly introduce some ideas related to the Android Development Challenge.

= Introduction =

We are planning to develop two projects for [http://code.google.com/android/adc.html Android Challenge]. The first one is a product line (or software factory) for 2d game development. The second one is proposed to offer several presence mechanisms for bag-packing, such as find out people with a specific perfil in a given location. 

It is important to notice that the software factory for 2d game development might be split into two distinct projects for the first and second "calls" of Android Challenge: in the first call, for example, we can release only the core APIs for 2d game (like sprite-tyles graphics, physics, and basic artifical intelligence); in the second call, instead, we can launch the software factory, with feature modeling support and product generators.    
 
= Team =

In the first moment, the development team is composed by:

  * Rodrigo Bonifácio (rba - rbonifacio123@gmail.com)
  * Kamy Lima Formiga Ponce (klfp - klfp@uol.com.br)

We are persuading two other friends to embrace these projects. The best organization, in our point of view, is just one developer in each project.

= First Iteraction =

|| Prototype the presence app || rba & klfp    || 18/02 || 28/02 ||  

*Milestone:* Go no go decision about which projects will be developed for the first call of Android Challenge.
