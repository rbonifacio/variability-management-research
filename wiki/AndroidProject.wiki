#summary One-sentence summary of this page.

= Introduction =

We are planning to develop two projects for [http://code.google.com/android/adc.html Android Challenge]. The first one is a product line (or software factory) for 2d game development. The second one is proposed to offer several presence mechanisms for bag-packing, such as find out people with a specific perfil in a given location. 

It is important to notice that the software factory for 2d game development might be split into two distinct projects for the first and second "calls" of Android Challenge: in the first call, for example, we can release only the core APIs for 2d game (like sprite-tyles graphics, physics, and basic artifical intelligence); in the second call, instead, we can launch the software factory, with feature modeling support and product generators.
