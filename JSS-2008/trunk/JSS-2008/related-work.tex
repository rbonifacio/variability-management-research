\subsubsection{Open Modules}

Open Modules is an approach for dealing with modularity issues in 
AOP~\cite{aldrich-ecoop-05}. Besides exposing data structures and 
functions, Open Modules' interfaces can also expose pointcuts denoting 
internal semantic of events. Clients of these modules are able to advice 
only exported pointcuts. Moreover, by exporting a pointcut, the module's 
developer is compromised to maintain the semantics of that pointcuts, 
which, in fact, mitigates the fragile pointcut problem.

%However, Open Modules do not offers mechanims for describing which 
%are the responsabilities of aspect developers. As a consequence, 
%module developers are still able to implement part of a concern 
%assigned for a different team and they can not assume the existence 
%of any behavior expected to be modularized as an aspect.
